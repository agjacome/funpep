A single protein, if it carries a glutamine/asparagine-rich ('prion') domain, can sometimes stably exist in at least two distinct physical states, each associated with a different phenotype; propagation of one of these traits is achieved by a self-perpetuating change in the protein from one form to the other, mediated by conformational changes in the glutamine/asparagine-rich domain. Prion domains are both modular and transferable to other proteins, on which they can confer a heritable epigenetic alteration of function; existing bioinformatics data indicate that they are rare in non-eukarya, but common in eukarya."

def: "The nitrogen phosphorus detector (NPD) (sometimes called the thermionic detector) is a very sensitive, specific detector the design of which, is based on the FID. Physically the sensor appears to be very similar to the FID but, in fact, operates on an entirely different principle. The nitrogen phosphorous detector (sometimes called the thermionic detector) is a very sensitive but specific detector that responds almost exclusively to nitrogen and phosphorous compounds. It is based on the flame ionization detector but differs in that it contains a rubidium or cesium silicate (glass) bead situated in a heater coil, a little distance from the hydrogen flame. If the detector is to respond to both nitrogen and phosphorous then the hydrogen flow should be minimal so that the gas does not ignite at the jet. If the detector is to respond to phosphorous only, a large flow of hydrogen is used which is burnt at the jet. The heated bead emits electrons by thermionic emission. These electrons are collected under a potential of a few volts by an appropriately placed anode, and provides a background current. When a solute containing nitrogen or phosphorous is eluted from the column, the partially combusted nitrogen and phosphorous materials are adsorbed on the surface of the bead. The adsorbed material reduces the work function of the surface and, as consequence, the emission of electrons is increased which raises the current collected at the electrode. The sensitivity of the detector to phosphorous is about 10-12 gram per ml and for nitrogen about 10-11 gram per ml at a signal to nose ratio of 2. The alkali bead as a finite life and needs regular replacement." []

Gasses in the mobile phase in the detector can produce completely unacceptable noise and, thus, must be removed. The dissolved gasses were originally removed under vacuum but, unfortunately, are soon replaced if the solvent is left in contact with air at atmospheric pressure. For this reason degassing is now usually carried out by bubbling helium through the mobile phase reservoirs. Secondly, vacuum is used in the thermionic detector. This consists of a device, very similar in design to the thermionic valve which is attached to a vacuum and a small quantity of the eluent from a gas chromatography column allowed to bleed through it. Helium is used as the carrier gas. The presence of solute vapor causes the thermionic current to fall. This type of detector tends to become contaminated rather readily." []

name: photoionization detector
def: "The selective determination of aromatic hydrocarbons or organo-heteroatom species is the job of the photoionization detector (PID). This device uses ultraviolet light as a means of ionizing an analyte exiting from a GC column. The ions produced by this process are collected by electrodes. The current generated is therefore a measure of the analyte concentration. f the amount of ionization is reproducible for a given compound, pressure, and light source then the current collected at the PID's reaction cell electrodes is reproducibly proportional to the amount of that compound entering the cell. The reason why the compounds that are routinely analyzed are either aromatic hydrocarbons or heteroatom containing compounds (like organosulfur or organophosphorus species) is because these species have ionization potentials (IP) that are within reach of commercially available UV lamps. The available lamp energies range from 8.3 to 11.7 ev, that is, lambda max ranging from 150 nm to 106 nm. Although most PIDs have only one lamp, lamps in the PID are exchanged depending on the compound selectivity required in the analysis." []

def: "A sample valve that must be able to sustain pressures up to 10,000 p.s.i., although it is most likely to operate on a continuous basis, at pressures of 3,000 p.s.i. or less. The higher the operating pressure the tighter the valve seating surfaces must be forced together to eliminate any leak. It follows that any abrasive material, however fine, that passes into the valve can cause the valve seating to become scored each time it is rotated which will ultimately lead to leaks. This will cause the sample size to vary between samples and eventually affect the accuracy of the analysis. It follows that any solid material must be carefully removed from any sample before filling the valve. The sample volume of an internal loop valve is situated in the connecting slot of the valve rotor and can be used only for relatively small sample volumes. Internal sample loop valves provide samples with volumes ranging from 0.1 ml to about 0.5 ml. Valve operation is shown in figure 6. The left-hand side diagram shows the load position. The sample occupies the rotor slot and has been filled by passing the sample from an appropriate syringe through the rotor slot to waste. While loading the sample, the mobile phase supply is passed through the valve directly to the column. To place the sample onto the column, the valve is then rotated and the valve slot containing the sample is now placed between the solvent supply and the column. As a result, the sample is passed into the column by the flow of solvent." []

On receiving a signal from the microprocessor, the next vial is placed under the column outlet and the eluate collected until receiving another signal from the computer. Once the properties of the chromatogram that describes the separation has been ascertained, then the collection program can be defined. The fractions can be collected on a basis of time either at regular intervals or a specific times to collect specific peaks. Alternatively the fractions can be collected by monitoring the detector output and when a peak starts to elute the fraction collector is activated and the peak collected in a specific vial. When the peak returns to base line the column eluate is then directed to waste until the next peak starts eluting. Fraction collectors are in common use with most liquid chromatographs.

name: flame photometric detector
def: "The determination of sulfur or phosphorus containing compounds is the job of the flame photometric detector (FPD). This device uses the chemiluminescent reactions of these compounds in a hydrogen/air flame as a source of analytical information that is relatively specific for substances containing these two kinds of atoms. The emitting species for sulfur compounds is excited S2. The lambda max for emission of excited S2 is approximately 394 nm. The emitter for phosphorus compounds in the flame is excited HPO (lambda max = doublet 510-526 nm). In order to selectively detect one or the other family of compounds as it elutes from the GC column, an interference filter is used between the flame and the photomultiplier tube (PMT) to isolate the appropriate emission band. The drawback here being that the filter must be exchanged between chromatographic runs if the other family of compounds is to be detected." []

name: Bruker 1mm MicroProbe
def: "Over the past few years there has been a significantly growing demand for miniaturization in all areas ofmodern research and development. Evoked by many exciting applications, there is a need for analytical methods which require less amounts of sample. Bruker BioSpin meets this challenge with a revolutionary NMR probe design: The 1mm MicroProbe. It operates with disposable 1mm capillary sample tubes and the sample volume of 5 microliters enables the use of lowest amounts of sample to run all high resolution NMR experiments with outstanding sensitivity and up to 16 times faster measurements. Due to the TXI-type probe design, the z-gradient coil and the automatic matching and tuning accessory, the 1mm MicroProbe can be used for a wide variety of NMR experiments. The key advantages of this probe include:\\n   up to 4 times higher mass sensitivity than 5mm conventional probes (with respect to the same sample amount)\\n   excellent solvent suppression properties\\n   virtually no salt effect\\n   discrete samples in tubes that can be sealed and stored\\n   automation accessory for sample preparation and handling available."

Pulsed Electrochemical Detection (PED) allows simple, sensitive, and direct detection of numerous polar aliphatic compounds, especially carbohydrates. This technique exploits the electrocatalytic activity of noble metal electrode surfaces to oxidize various polar functional groups. In PED, multi-step potential-time waveforms at Au and Pt electrodes realize amperometric/coulometric detection while maintaining uniform and reproducible electrode activity. The response mechanisms in PED are dominated by the surface properties of the electrode, and, as a consequence, members of each chemical class of compounds produce virtually identical voltammetric responses. Thus, the full potential is realized when combined with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)." []

In addition to non-chromatographic applications, nitrogen/sulfur chemiluminescence detection has been adapted to various chromatographic techniques from gas chromatography to liquid and supercritical fluid chromatography as specialized element-specific detectors. The characteristics of these detectors are evaluated and compared to other element-selective detection techniques.

def: "The chart recorder is a device that transduces signal-intensities into a graphical peak output: As the separated components of the gas sample emerge into the detector, the change in voltage in the detecting bridge circuit causes a representative peak to be drawn on a chart recorder. The position of the peak along the time axis of the chart measures the component's retention time, which identifies the component. This is directly related to carrier gas flow rate, temperature and column packing and dimensions. The area under each peak is proportional to the concentration of the component of the sample. The area of the peaks inscribed on the chart recorder can be determined by multiplying the height of the peak in mm, by the width of the peak in mm at 1/2 the peak height. The calibration curves for use with the chart recorder are therefore peak area plotted against concentration." []

Unfortunately, the fraction taken in this way may not be representative of the original sample. This is due to the individual solutes in the mixture having different diffusivities and, thus, they distribute themselves across the sampling tube in an irregular manner.

name: prothrombin time assay
def: "The prothrombin time is an assay most commonly measured using blood plasma. Blood is drawn into a test tube containing liquid citrate, which acts as an anticoagulant by binding the calcium in a sample. The blood is mixed, then centrifuged to separate blood cells from plasma. In newborns, whole blood is used. The plasma is analyzed by a biomedical scientist on an automated instrument at 37 degrees C, which takes a sample of the plasma. An excess of calcium is added (thereby reversing the effects of citrate), which enables the blood to clot again. For an accurate measurement the proportion of blood to citrate needs to be fixed; many laboratories will not perform the assay if the tube is underfilled and contains a relatively high concentration of citrate. If the tube is underfilled or overfilled with blood, the standardized dilution of 1 part anticoagulant to 9 parts whole blood is no longer valid. For the prothrombin time test the appropriate sample is the blue top tube, or sodium citrate tube, which is a liquid anticoagulant. Tissue factor (also known as factor III or thromboplastin) is added, and the time the sample takes to clot is measured optically. Some laboratories use a mechanical measurement, which eliminates interferences from lipemic and icteric samples. The prothrombin ratio is the prothrombin time for a patient, divided by the result for control plasma." []

def: "A Spectrolyse Heparin (Xa) assay is intended for the quantitative determination of therapeutic Heparin in human plasma.\n\nThe principle inhibitor of Thrombin, Factor Xa and other coagulation serine proteases in plasma is Antithrombin III. The rate of inhibition, under normal conditions, is slow, but can be increased several thousand-fold by Heparin. This mechanism accounts for the anticoagulant effect of Heparin. Low Molecular Weight Therapeutic Heparin (LMWH) preparations appear to catalyze the reaction between Factor Xa and Antithrombin III more readily than the reaction between Thrombin and Antithrombin III while standard Heparin catalyzes both reactions equally. The Factor Xa inhibition test is the most useful test for assaying the widest variety of therapeutic Heparin preparations. In this method, when both Factor Xa and Antithrombin III are present in excess, the rate of Factor Xa inhibition is directly proportional to the Heparin concentration. The residual Factor Xa activity, measured with a Factor Xa-specific chromogenic substrate, is inversely proportional to the Heparin concentration." []

These fused proteins are called the bait and prey, respectively. In addition to being fused to an integral membrane protein, the Cub moiety is also fused to a transcription factor (TF) that can be cleaved off by ubiquitin specific proteases. Upon bait–prey interaction, Nub and Cub-moieties assemble, reconstituting the split-ubiquitin. The reconstituted split-ubiquitin molecule is recognized by ubiquitin specific proteases, which cleave off the reporter protein, allowing it to induce the transcription of reporter genes." []

For two-hybrid screening, the transcription factor is split into two separate fragments, called the binding domain (BD) and activating domain (AD).

In parallel, a library of randomized oligonucleotides representing potential TF target sequences, is cloned into a separate vector containing the selectable genes HIS3 and URA3. If the DNA-binding domain (bait) binds a potential DNA target site (prey) in vivo, it will recruit RNA polymerase to the promoter and activate transcription of the reporter genes in that clone. The two reporter genes, HIS3 and URA3, allow for positive and negative selections, respectively.

The type of lamp is often named by the gas contained in the bulb; including neon, argon, xenon, krypton, sodium, metal halide, and mercury. The electric arc in an arc lamp consists of gas which is initially ionized by a voltage and is therefore electrically conductive. To start an arc lamp, usually a very high voltage is needed to ignite or strike the arc. This requires an electrical circuit sometimes called an igniter, which is part of a larger circuit called the ballast. The ballast supplies a suitable voltage and current to the lamp as its electrical characteristics change with temperature and time. Older cytometers may use arc lamps to irradiate particles at the interrogation point." []
